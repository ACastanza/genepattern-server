/**
 * BrowserLauncher is a class that provides one static method, openURL, which
 * opens the default web browser for the current user of the system to the given
 * URL. It may support other protocols depending on the system -- mailto, ftp,
 * etc. -- but that has not been rigorously tested and is not guaranteed to
 * work.
 * <p>
 * Yes, this is platform-specific code, and yes, it may rely on classes on
 * certain platforms that are not part of the standard JDK. What we're trying to
 * do, though, is to take something that's frequently desirable but inherently
 * platform-specific -- opening a default browser -- and allow programmers (you,
 * for example) to do so without worrying about dropping into native code or
 * doing anything else similarly evil.
 * <p>
 * Anyway, this code is completely in Java and will run on all JDK 1.1-compliant
 * systems without modification or a need for additional libraries. All classes
 * that are required on certain platforms to allow this to run are dynamically
 * loaded at runtime via reflection and, if not found, will not cause this to do
 * anything other than returning an error when opening the browser.
 * <p>
 * There are certain system requirements for this class, as it's running through
 * Runtime.exec(), which is Java's way of making a native system call.
 * Currently, this requires that a Macintosh have a Finder which supports the
 * GURL event, which is true for Mac OS 8.0 and 8.1 systems that have the
 * Internet Scripting AppleScript dictionary installed in the Scripting
 * Additions folder in the Extensions folder (which is installed by default as
 * far as I know under Mac OS 8.0 and 8.1), and for all Mac OS 8.5 and later
 * systems. On Windows, it only runs under Win32 systems (Windows 95, 98, and NT
 * 4.0, as well as later versions of all). On other systems, this drops back
 * from the inherently platform-sensitive concept of a default browser and
 * simply attempts to launch Netscape via a shell command.
 * <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Errors can be caused by problems with the data or because
of bugs in the program or tasks. &nbsp;If you think you have found a bug
please <b>check the FAQ first!</b> The GenePattern FAQ (frequently asked
questions) may already list the issue you have identified and could have
a work-around or other instructions or explainations. &nbsp;Once again please
check the FAQ first before reporting a bug. &nbsp;If you think that you have
identified a new bug, include an example, if possible, so that it can be
reproduced. &nbsp;

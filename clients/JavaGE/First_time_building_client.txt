The first time the graphical environment client is built must be from the root of the repository. Thus you will have to go up two directories.  Type:
> cd ../..

and run the ant script GPGE:
> ant GPGE

This will create all the neccessary support jars that the graphical environment needs.  After that the client can be compiled or the jar file created in this directory by typing:
> ant compile
      or
> ant package

Migrating HSQLDB from version 1.8.1-3 to version 2.3.2.

The newer version is not completely compatible when updating your GenePattern Server from <= 3.9.2 to >= 3.9.3.
The GenePatternDB.script file generated by the older 1.8.1-3 hsqldb.jar results in parser errors when it is loaded
from the newer 2.3.2 jar. The error is X_42522, "a UNIQUE constraint already exists on the set of columns".
I found two cases when testing a standard update from 3.9.2 to 3.9.3.

I consider this an obscure bug in hsqldb so I created a patch and a new jar file which will ignore the error
instead of throwing an exception.

The patch: src-2.3.2-ignoreX_42522.patch
The jar: hsqldb-2.3.2-patch-for-gp.jar

Note: If you run into problems and must recover the original database you have two remedies:
(a) Use the previous 1.8.1-3 version of the hsqldb.jar file. Add it to the WEB-INF/lib folder
    of your server and restart. We use the 'hsqldb.jar' file name because it is hard-coded
    into some of our scripts.
    
(b) Manually edit the GenePatternDB.script file. This is a fairly simple process of scanning for
    the offending line in the script file and identifying the incompatibility. During my testing
    I found two offending lines; both caused by redundant constraint declarations. 
    
If for some unforeseen reason you need to revert back to the original HSQL 2.3.2 behavior,
set the 'hsqldb.ignoreX_42522' system property to 'false'. Here is the code snippet which checks:

    boolean ignore=Boolean.valueOf( System.getProperty("hsqldb.ignoreX_42522", "true" ));

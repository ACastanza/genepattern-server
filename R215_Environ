# Use R_LIBS_USER for user-level libraries (if desired).  Not here; set in the R_ENVIRON_USER
# for that particular user.  Just adding it here as a note.

# Forcibly ignore the R_LIBS setting.  Both the Broad DotKit and the IU Module add an unwritable 
# system directory here that interferes with installation.  Besides, we don't want to load 
# packages from areas we don't control (other than .Library).  This will also disable loading
# settings form implied locations (e.g. ~/.Renviron, etc.).

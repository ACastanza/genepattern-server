The css, dtd, and xsl directories are what you would expect. 

The cms directory is essentially the doc directory of the ComparativeMarkerSelection module:

- cms.xml is the source file. 
- cms.html was generated using SAXON: 

java -jar saxon9.jar -t -s:cms/cms.xml -xsl:xsl/module_doc.xslt -o:cms/cms.html


Next steps for Heidi:
- create a few more xml files: GISTIC, CMSViewer, PreprocessDataset, perhaps a few others
- work with Jon to modify the css to improve the layout

The css, dtd, and xsl directories are what you would expect. 

The cms directory is essentially the doc directory of the ComparativeMarkerSelection module:

- cms.xml is the source file. 
- cms.html was generated using SAXON: 

java -jar saxon9.jar -t -s:cms/cms.xml -xsl:xsl/module_doc.xslt -o:cms/cms.html


Next steps for Heidi:

- correct the following errors in the xslt for CMS: 
(1) under parameters, example files aren't being displayed (example Result files are displayed); 
(2) under parameters, file format is not being displayed; 
(3) CMS uses uploaded example files, GISTIC uses URLs for example files; XML and XSLT need to be modified to handle both cases; 
(4) notice in the output that some paragraphs use <p> and others don't; this needs to be addressed and made consistent; 
(5) under References, the HTML is displaying HTML tags, eg <i> and </i>; (6) under Platform Dependencies, Task Type is missing; 
(7) add Related Modules section to the end of the XSLT.   

- create a few more xml files: GISTIC, CMSViewer, PreprocessDataset, perhaps a few others

- work with Jon to modify the css to improve the layout

- Add attribution field to XML and XSLT. Based on email from Helga 9/10/08: Some of our modules are ones where we have wrapped an implementation from somewhere else. Currently in the module doc we say that we authored these modules.  We need better attribution to the original implementation. Perhaps author - wrapper and and author - algorithm implementor; or author and attribution.

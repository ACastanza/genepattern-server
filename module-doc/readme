The css, dtd, and xsl directories are what you would expect. 

The cms directory is essentially the doc directory of the ComparativeMarkerSelection module:

- cms.xml is the source file. 
- cms.html was generated using SAXON: 

java -jar saxon9.jar -t -s:cms/cms.xml -xsl:xsl/module_doc.xslt -o:cms/cms.html


Next steps for Heidi:
- correct the following errors in the xslt for CMS: 
(1) under parameters, example files aren't being displayed (example Result files are displayed); 
(2) under parameters, file format is not being displayed; 
(3) CMS uses uploaded example files, GISTIC uses URLs for example files; XML and XSLT need to be modified to handle both cases; 
(4) notice in the output that some paragraphs use <p> and others don't; this needs to be addressed and made consistent; 
(5) under References, the HTML is displaying HTML tags, eg <i> and </i>; (6) under Platform Dependencies, Task Type is missing; 
(7) add Related Modules section to the end of the XSLT.   
- create a few more xml files: GISTIC, CMSViewer, PreprocessDataset, perhaps a few others
- work with Jon to modify the css to improve the layout

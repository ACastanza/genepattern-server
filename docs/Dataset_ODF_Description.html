<h2 style="text-align: center;">Dataset ODF format</h2>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
This document can only be understood in the context of the ODF Format
documention.&nbsp; If you have not done so please read it first (<a
 href="ODF_format_documentation.html">ODF Documentation</a>). <br>
<br>
The ODF format is supposed to be somewhat similar to the RES or GCT
file formats for Datasets.&nbsp; The main difference is in the
header.&nbsp; The body of data contains the expression level values for
each gene in each sample. Thus the main data block (after the header
lines) is a matrix of values.&nbsp; The matrices
columns are defined by a name and optionally a description.&nbsp; The
rows have a name (name of the gene for instance) and a description
(description of the gene).&nbsp; The columns are the expression values
for each gene in a sample.&nbsp; Each sample has expression values for
the same named gene in a row.&nbsp; So if the first gene is a
particular Tyrosine Kinase then each of the samples will have
expressions values for that particular Tyrosine Kinase in the first
row. See the <a href="Example_Dataset.odf">Example_Dataset.odf</a> for
reference.<br>
<h3>Typical ODF header for a Dataset</h3>
<ol>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">ODF 1.0</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">HeaderLines=7</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">Model=&nbsp; Dataset</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">COLUMN_NAMES:&nbsp;&nbsp;
Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Description&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sample
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biopsy_2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Biopsy_4 </li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">COLUMN_DESCRIPTIONS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sample from DFCI&nbsp; Sample from UK&nbsp;&nbsp; Sample from Children's</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">COLUMN_TYPES:&nbsp;&nbsp;
String&nbsp; String&nbsp;
float&nbsp; float&nbsp; float</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">RowNamesColumn=0</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">RowDescriptionsColumn=1</li>
  <li style="font-family: monospace;">DataLines= 3<br>
  </li>
</ol>
Lines 1 and 2 are the required first and second lines that signify that
this is an ODF formatted file and how many header lines follow before
the main data block.&nbsp; Line 3, required to be somewhere in the
header of an ODF file, defines this ODF file as containing Dataset
data.&nbsp; Line 4 is the tab delimited list of names of the columns.
Line 5 is the tab delimited list of column descriptions for each
column. Line 6, is required for any ODF file that has a main data
block, defines the type of data in each column.&nbsp; Line 7 defines
which column will have the row names.&nbsp; Line 8 defines which column
will have the row descriptions.&nbsp; Line 9, is required for any ODF
file that has a main data block, is the number of rows in the main data
block.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes:</span><br>
<br>
The number of data lines can be quite large. For example, the U133A
chip measures the expression values for about 20,000 human genes.&nbsp;
A Dataset created from several samples using the U133A gene chip could
have a large value for the DataLines tag.<br>
<br>
The COLUMN_NAMES:, COLUMN_DESCRIPTIONS:, and COLUMN_TYPES: lists
must have the same number of elements.&nbsp; Also the number of
elements must be equal to the number of columns in the main data block.<br>
<br>
The COLUMN_NAMES:, and&nbsp; COLUMN_DESCRIPTIONS: could be empty, that
is with the proper number of tabs and no text.<br>
<br>
The row names and row descriptions could be defined as ROW_NAMES:, and
ROW_DESCRIPTIONS: lists instead of having columns containing the row
names and descriptions.&nbsp; This is like the COLUMN_NAMES:,
COLUMN_DESCRIPTIONS: lists.&nbsp; Either ROW_NAMES: or RowNamesColumn=
tags will be used, but
not both. The same goes for using either ROW_DESCRIPTIONS: or
RowDescriptionsColumn= but not both.<br>
<br>
General note about the header: It is possible that modified dataset
files could exist that have additional tags not defined here.&nbsp; Any
parser of a dataset should not fail if this is encountered but just
keep track of the unknown attributes.&nbsp; Or at the very least ignore
them.<br>
<h3>Main Data Block (example first few lines)</h3>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">1000_at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X60188

<br>
The main data block is consistent with the header.&nbsp; The first
COLUMN_NAMES element is "Name".&nbsp; This label is associated with the
first&nbsp; column (values: 1000_at, 1001_at, and 1002_f_at).&nbsp; The
second column's label is "Description" which is associated with the
second column of the main data block.&nbsp; The next three columns are
floating point numbers that represent the gene expression values for
each of the samples.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes:</span><br>
<br>
The first two columns are just text data, and next three columns only
contain floating point values.&nbsp; This is consistent with the
String, String, float, float, float elements in the COLUMN_TYPES: list.<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><b>OmniSci Data Format (ODF) for files
of Genes or Samples Properties</b><span style="font-weight: bold;">, </span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">formerly the </span><b> Self
Documenting Format (SDF)</b><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
Only the first two lines are initially expected by the parser:<br>
<br>
ODF 1.0<br>
HeaderLines= int<br>
DataLines= int<br>
Model= String<br>
<br>
Where the first line identifies this file as a ODF file version 1.0.
&nbsp; The
second line indicates the number of other header lines that will
immediately
follow:
<ol>
  <li><b>ODF 1.0</b> &nbsp; &nbsp;(The magic string identifying this
file as a OmniSci data format file version 1.0 Note: that SDF 1.0
should also be expected and accepted by a parser)</li>
  <li><b>HeaderLines= int&nbsp;</b> &nbsp; (The number of additional
header lines that
follow before the main data block)</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">DataLines= int&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>(The
number of lines of data in the table that follows the header lines.
This
must be present somewhere in the header even if it is zero)</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Model= String</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(This keyword is also required.&nbsp; It identifies what type of data
object this file's content represents.) <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>KeyWord1=</b> Value1 (An assignment)<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>KEY_WORD: </b>Item one&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Item
two&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Item three&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;etc.&nbsp; (A
delimited list of Strings that can represent other Objects such as
numbers, dates,&nbsp; etc.)<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"># </span>Human-readable
comments that are not parsed and not tallied in the
header line count found on line two.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">KeyWord3=</span> Value3<br>
  </li>
</ol>
The first token of each header line will be a key word. &nbsp;The key
word defines/describes
what kind of meta data will be found on the rest of that line. We can
define
some basic key words initially but others may be introduced later
without
causing problems with current parsers. Internally the values on a line
will
be associated with the keyword. &nbsp;If the parser does not know the
significance
of a keyword a warning message be created, optional, but this will not
be an error
and parsing will continue.<br>
<br>
By convention, assignments will have only the first letter of a word or
words
in the key word capitalized and will be followed by an equals sign. For
example <b>DataLines= 12626</b>. The key word is made from two words
that are capitalized and concatinated together with out a space or
other seperator.&nbsp; The key words that are followed by a list of
delimited strings
will be in all capitals then a colon. &nbsp;For example<b>
COLUMN_NAMES: Colon cancer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brain
cancer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colon normal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brain normal</b>.
&nbsp;The parser will be more forgiving
though, and will accept any case for the keywords and even white space
characters
between the key word and the equals or colon characters.&nbsp; The
default delimiter will be a tab character (\t) see DELIMITER.<br>
<br>
<h2>Standard key words:</h2>
<br>
<b> COLUMN_NAMES: <br>
</b>A delimited list of column names. Where the first column name will
be
assigned to the first column the second column name to the second
column
etc. &nbsp;See below for a full example.<br>
<b><br>
</b><b> COLUMN_</b><b>DESCRIPTIONS:<br>
</b>A delimited list of column description strings. Where the first
column&nbsp;description
will be assigned to the first column the second column&nbsp;description
to the
second column etc. &nbsp;See below for a full example.<br>
<b><br>
</b><b> COLUMN_</b><b>TYPES:</b><br>
This defines how the main data lines will be converted to an internal
format.
&nbsp;It also allows some verification of the integrity of the format
of the data.
&nbsp;For example if a column is defined to be of type <big><small><tt>int</tt>
and the parser finds the value 2143658709</small></big> in that column
it will be converted to a signed 4 byte integer value instead of a
10 character String (20 bytes). &nbsp;So numerical data should take up
much less
space which will be important with large data files. This process also
makes
sure that the value represented really is a number. &nbsp;If this
keyword is not
present the parser will use the default String representation for each
column.
<br>
<br>
The following types will be initially supported:<br>

</table>
<br>
<br>
<b>Model=<br>
</b>The identifier given to this set of data. &nbsp;For example the
following
are possible models "Prediction Results" or "Gene Properties" or
"Dataset"
(no quotes). <br>
<br>
Model = Prediction Results<br>
<b><br>
ROW_NAMES:<br>
</b>A line that lists the names of the rows for a "Row Header" - the
row
version of the Column Header. &nbsp;See "RowNamesColumn= int" below.<br>
<br>
<b>ROW_DESCRIPTIONS:<br>
</b>A line that lists the descriptions of the rows for a "Row Header" -
the
row version of the Column Header. &nbsp;See "RowDescriptionsColumn=
int" below.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>RowNamesColumn= int</b><br>
The int value is the number of the column that will have names for each
row.
&nbsp;This is one way of defining the row names without putting them
all on a
single line. &nbsp;Instead each row will have its' name. See
"ROW_NAMES:".<br>
<br>
<b>RowDescriptionsColumn= int</b><br>
The int value is the number of the column that will have the
descriptions
for each row. &nbsp;This is one way of defining the row descriptions
without putting
them all on a single line. &nbsp;Instead each row will have its'
description.&nbsp;
See "ROW_DESCRIPTIONS:".<br>
<br>
<b>DELIMITER: </b>"delimiter string" "next delimiter string"<br>
No<span style="font-style: italic;">te this feature is not implemented
with the Java parser and only tabs are used as delimiters(the default).</span><br>
If defined, it should be found on the third line. &nbsp;Otherwise the
parser will
use tabs, the default, in parsing the header lines until this line
redefines
the delimiter or delimiters. &nbsp;If not defined the default value is
the tab
character, "\t". It defines the delimiter string that will be used to
separate
data elements on a line that contains a list of items. &nbsp;There can
be more
than one delimiter defined. &nbsp;Use the Unix-like convention for
defining control
characters with a slash and then a letter (i.e. \t = tab \n= new line
etc.).
&nbsp;For example:<br>
<small><br>
</small>ODF 1.0<br>
HeaderLines= 3 &nbsp;<br>
# change the delimiters to include the string "&lt;&gt;" as well as the
tab
character - this is <u>not</u> equivalent to "&lt;&gt;\t"<br>
DELIMITER: "\t" "&lt;&gt;"<br>
Model= Prediction Results<br>
COLUMN_NAMES: This one&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That one&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
third one<br>
<br>
<br>
The DELIMITER: line defines that after the third line all data elements
in
a line with list data will be separated by either a tab or a open
brackets
- close brackets string. &nbsp;These delimiters will be applied to all
subsequent
lines in the file (header lines as well as main data lines).<br>
<br>
<b>DataLines= int</b><br>
The integer value is the number of data lines. &nbsp;The data lines
begin after
the header lines and remarks. &nbsp;If the integer value is negative or
if the
DataLines assignment is absent then the number of data lines is unknown.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<big style="font-weight: bold;">#</big><br style="font-weight: bold;">
A remark is a human readable comment that is skipped by the parser.
This
line starts with the "#" character and can contain any type of text
since
it is not parsed. &nbsp; Note that remarks are not counted as header
lines and
the user can&nbsp; insert them "by hand".<br>

For testing the InstallAnywhere installer. What happened to the '../tags/' folder?
It's in svn. It's in GitHub. It's in the working directory for the Jenkins GenePattern_Git_Release project.

It does not make it into the gpdev deploy after running the installer.
    ls /xchip/gpdev/servers/gp-trunk/gp/Tomcat/webapps/gp/js/jquery/tags/

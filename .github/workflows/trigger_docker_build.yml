# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Trigger_docker_build

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch.  For this one it needs a tag with a leading lowercase 'v'
# as we normally use for releases
on:
  push:
    tags: 
      - v*
 

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "send_dispatch_event"
  send_dispatch_event:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    # not needed yet, but leaving in as its part of the template
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Runs a single command using the runners shell, just as an example
    - name: Run a one-line script
      run: echo Hello, world!

    # multi-line scripts need the '|' on the first line
    # the ${{ github.ref }} in the payload will be the tag like so 'refs/tags/v0.23'
    # which the other side will use to look for an installer at 
    # https://github.com/genepattern/github-actions-testing/releases/download/v0.23/GPserver.bin
    # so it will strip the refs/tags at the destination
